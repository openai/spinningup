Spinning Up requires Python3, MuJoCo, OpenAI Gym, and OpenMPI.

Spinning Up is currently only supported on Linux and OSX. It may be possible to install on Windows, though this hasn't been tested. (If you try this and succeed, please let us know how you did it!)


Installing Python
=================

We recommend installing Python through Anaconda. Anaconda is a library that includes Python and many useful packages for Python, as well as an environment manager called conda that makes package management simple.

Follow `the installation instructions`_ for Anaconda here. Download and install Anaconda 3.x (at time of writing, 3.6). Then create a conda env for organizing packages used in Spinning Up:

.. parsed-literal::

    conda create -n spinningup python=3.6

To use Python from the environment you just created, activate the environment with:

.. parsed-literal::

    source activate spinningup

.. admonition:: You Should Know

    If you're new to python environments and package management, this stuff can quickly get confusing or overwhelming, and you'll probably hit some snags along the way. (Especially, you should expect problems like, "I just installed this thing, but it says it's not found when I try to use it!") You may want to read through some clean explanations about what package management is, why it's a good idea, and what commands you'll typically have to execute to correctly use it. 

    `FreeCodeCamp`_ has a good explanation worth reading. There's a shorter description on `Towards Data Science`_ which is also helpful and informative. Finally, if you're an extremely patient person, you may want to read the (dry, but very informative) `documentation page from Conda`_.

Installing MuJoCo and OpenAI Gym
================================

First, go to the `mujoco-py`_ github page. Follow the installation instructions in the README, which describe how to install the MuJoCo physics engine and the mujoco-py package (which allows the use of MuJoCo from Python). 

.. admonition:: You Should Know

    In order to use the MuJoCo simulator, you will need to get a `MuJoCo license`_. Free 30-day licenses are available to anyone, and free 1-year licenses are available to full-time students.

Next, go to the `Gym`_ github page, and follow the "Installing Everything" instructions in the README.

Make sure to install MuJoCo and mujoco-py *before* installing Gym, to ensure that the Gym mujoco environments are set up correctly.

Installing OpenMPI
==================

Ubuntu 
------

.. parsed-literal::

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev


Mac OS X
--------
Installation of system packages on Mac requires Homebrew_. With Homebrew installed, run the follwing:

.. parsed-literal::

    brew install openmpi

.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh

Installing Spinning Up
======================

.. parsed-literal::

    git clone https://github.com/openai/spinningup.git
    cd spinningup
    pip install -e .


Check Your Install
==================

To see if you've successfully installed Spinning Up, try running PPO in the Walker2d-v2 environment with

.. parsed-literal::

    python -m spinup.run ppo --hid [32,32] --env Walker2d-v2 --exp_name installtest

This might run for around 10 minutes, and you can leave it going in the background while you continue reading through documentation. This won't train the agent to completion, but will run it for long enough that you can see *some* learning progress when the results come in.

After it finishes training, watch a video of the trained policy with

.. parsed-literal::

    python -m spinup.run test_policy data/installtest/installtest_s0

And plot the results with

.. parsed-literal::

    python -m spinup.run plot data/installtest/installtest_s0
