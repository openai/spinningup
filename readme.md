## This is a fork of the OpenAI Spinning Up in the Deep RL repository.
The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/spinningup)
This fork is intended to be an up-to-date version of the original repository, with the following changes:

The code has been updated to be compatible with Pytorch version 1.7.1 <br>
We updated readme files and other documentation to be more accessible for beginners. <br>
We also provided a step-by-step guide for downloading and installing Spinningup on Windows(11) Without using a Linux subsystem. <br>
It removes the Windows community's barrier to diving into the Deep RL research platform. <br>

## Installation for Windows

This is a step-by-step guide for running spinning up on Windows:

## Download & Installation:
**Step 1:** Download  and Install [ Anaconda ](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [ Miniconda ](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Windows.

**Step 2:** 
- Download Microsoft c++ build tools from [ here ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- While Installing, select  _**Desktop development with C++**_ :

**Step 2:** 
- Open Anaconda prompt 
- Create "spinningup" environment by executing the command `conda create -n spinningup python=3.6`. 
- Now activate "spinningup" environment by executing the command `conda activate spinningup`

**Step 4:**
- Ensure that you have the "git" installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Clone the "spinningup" repository: 
  - you can either use my forked version using the command: `git clone https://github.com/mj06879/spinningup_on_Windows11` <br>
  - Or you can use the master branch using the command: `git clone https://github.com/openai/spinningup.git` <br>
    In the case of the master branch, once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the directory "Spinningup" and locate the "setup.py" file. Proceed to modify the Torch version to 1.7.1 within that file as shown below:

**Step 5:**
- Install **_Swig_** by running command `pip install swig`
- Install openCV-Python by running command `pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30`
- Install mpi4py by running command `Conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py`

**Step 6:**
- Navigate to the "Spinningup" directory using the command: `cd spinningup`.
- Now run command `pip install -e .` 

## Check Your Install:
- Follow the spinningup tutorial to check your installation from [here](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/installation.html#check-your-install)

you may come across error while plotting the results using the given command

```
**Solution:**
This can be due to the path error your system would be facing. You can update the command by editing the path of `installest_s0`. you can just go to the folder and can copy the path:
```
python -m spinup.run plot C:\Users\project\spinningup\data\installtest\installtest_s0
```

**Note:** The installation has been done and run over Windows 11.


Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! 
==================================

This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
- a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
- a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
- and a few [exercises](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.
