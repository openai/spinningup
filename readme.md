# Spinning Up fork with a simple setup
This is the fork of the [openai/spinningup](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) repo which aims to simplify dependencies and relax version constraints in setup.py, so the spinningup package can be more easily used as a dependency on other projects.

Crucially, please note that tensorflow has been removed as default dependency, and modules dependent on TF are simply not loaded if tensorflow is not available in the environment (unless imported explicitly by the user).

The rest of this readme.md comes from the original repo:

**Status:** Maintenance (expect bug fixes and minor updates)

Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! 
==================================

This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
- a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
- a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
- and a few [exercises](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.
