# STAC Moon Rover Training!

To run, follow along at https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/
for installation  (except git pull this instead of the openai og
github!).

Also I think you'll need to git clone the `airover` `tm` branch
into the spinningup folder.  I'll fix it soon, don't worry.

Setup stuff for docker!  Get gazebo running.

Then, from the base spinningup folder, run `python test.py`.

Done!
