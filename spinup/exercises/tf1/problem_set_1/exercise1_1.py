Exercise 1.1: Diagonal Gaussian Likelihood

Write a function which takes in Tensorflow symbols for the means and 
log stds of a batch of diagonal Gaussian distributions, along with a 
Tensorflow placeholder for (previously-generated) samples from those 
distributions, and returns a Tensorflow symbol for computing the log 
likelihoods of those samples.
